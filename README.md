# rock-paper-and-scissor
# This is my first project and I choose python to implement my project.
# The name of the project is "Rock paper and scissor".
# A normal game we used to play when we were kids and I tried to replicate it in programming 
# So, I used very basic and simple python language to make it more simple and understandable
# There are two modes :
#                       First: we can play with computer.
#                      Second: we play as player 1 and with player 2
